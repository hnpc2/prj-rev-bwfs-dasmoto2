  <!--
  1) How do I put "Starting at $..." after p? Currently it is placed on different lines. First p, than p class=prices. (e.g. line 18 + 19)
  2) How can I put a space before "Brushes" or "Frames" (coloered headings) for aestheic reasons? (e.g. line 22)
  3) First I used section instead of div: The heading size changes within section. Why is h1 in section smaller or independent?
  I am new to CSS :D
  4) Why is my background-image not shown? -> I used \ instead of / -> Failulre comes during copy paste. -> What can I do?
  5) Why do I not see the brush photo with my CSS code? Only when I fix the width and height to e.g. 200px. (In line 15 index.html, bottom master.css)
